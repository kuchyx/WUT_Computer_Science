# I will be talking about ethicality of using things "created" by AI
Using AI "creations" ethics

# Thats my research question 
Question:
     Is using AI creations ethical?

# The original way I wanted to address it and the most popular one is by talking about ai intentions, whether AI has intention to do something or not
Intensions

# So basically we try to answer the question whether this is AI
@dontknow.jpg

# Or this
@know.jpg

# The way I want to approach it is by saying that it does not matter and sideline all complicated aspects of intentionality
Argument:
     It does not matter

#  because AI is a tool 
AI is a tool

# And that is nothing new we already have tools that make creating art easier like
Examples of tools that
make creating art easier

# Graphical tablet which can be a substition for pretty much any tool 
@tablet.jpg

# Software that provides artists with ability to do stuff like undo changes, copy changes, work in layers easily and so on
@photoshop.jpg

# Or a simple brush which provides the artists with more control over applying paint when compared with bare hands
@brush.jpg

# But we don't care about "intensions" of those tools do we?
Do we argue whether
a brush has intention
to create something?

# Now, someone can argue that those tools require skill and work to operate
skill issue

# but so does AI
AI creations NEED human input

# Here are some of the steps needed to create AI art from scratch
Steps necessary to create AI art:
⚫ Collect Data
⚫ Preprocess Data 
⚫ Train AI model
⚫ Refine AI model 
⚫ Iterate
⚫ Provide inputs (not stupid)

# Now someone can argue that most of those steps are already done
ready-made AI

# But so are AI tools, artists usually buy tools created by someone else, on the photo we have a 19th century brush maker 
@brushmaker.jpg

# This extends not only to artists but to pretty much any profession (coders, copywriters etc...)
# So a sensible objection to using AI to create things would be that this takes over human jobs
What about
(insert your profession here)?

# And this is nothing 
This is nothing new

# Automatization happened over and over in human history and will happen again
Automatization happens

# Here are some examples of jobs that were mostly taken by machine 
Jobs that are either
dead or dying

# Like a loom weavers who were replaced by weaving machines
@weaver.jpg

# Switchboard operators replaced by automatic telephone switchboards
@switchboard.jpeg

# If you ever got a call about solar panels you know that telemarketers are also slowly being replaced
@telemarketer.webp

# Another issue with AI creations is that it uses human creations
AI uses human work

# And same can be said about humans
So are humans

# Here is a quote I stole
@steal.webp

# Here is a meme I stole 
@stealCode.webp

# Now someone can argue that AI is inferior to humans so it cannot use human creations like humans 
AI != humans

# And I would argue that the actual beings that collect data for AI are humans themselves who choose data for AI
AI creators (human) 
use human work

# Another argument against AI is that ai creations are not perfect and can lead to mistakes
AI errors

# Here is an example of autocorrect choosing wrong word to send
# Among many explanation for that one of the possible ones is that autocorrect does not understand context of the text
@dexter.webp

# And I would say that it is our responsiblity to understand technological limitations and use them sensibly 
Bad workman always
blames his tools

# Another argument against AI creations is that it is unoriginal since it uses already existing data to create things
Unoriginality

# First of all originality is hard to define
elusive originality definition

# Second of all humans can also be unoriginal
Humans can be unoriginal too

# Like here
@unoriginal.png

# And I would say that it is not always a bad thing to be unoriginal
Is it always bad?

# Certainly in emergency situations we want people to follow simple instructions ensuring their survival
@book.jpg

# Or when we design a website and want users to understand what they need to do by using uniform design that they are familiar with
@material.png

# So I would say that AI intentions do not really matter in this case, AI is just a tool like any other tool and it is fine to use AI creations
AI intentions do not matter 
AI is a tool
Using AI "creations" is fine

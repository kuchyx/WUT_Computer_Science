# WUT_Computer_Science
This repository aims to consolidate every single project I did solo during my Computer Science course on Warsaw University of Technology </br>
It does not contain multiple projects that I did in a group like: </br>
https://github.com/PolishPigeon/E-PSYOPS - Unity Game used to pass last 3 laboratories of EOPSY course </br>
https://github.com/BartDrown/polygon-21z - Unity Game for my third Polygon Project </br>
https://gitlab.com/Maciekxdabu/polygon-22l-samochdzik - Unity Game for my fourth Polygon Project </br>
And tens of reports from laboratories done either solo or in group.
